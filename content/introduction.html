    <h3>Things to Consider:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Code knowledge</strong>: If you want to write your manual in pure HTML and CSS, you'll need some familiarity with basic web development concepts like HTML structure, CSS styling, and linking pages.</li>
       <li><strong>Customization</strong>: With this approach, you're fully in control of the design and structure, which is great for tailored, minimalistic manuals.</li>
       <li><strong>Live Preview</strong>: Editors like <strong>Brackets</strong>, <strong>VS Code</strong>, and <strong>Pinegrow</strong> make it easy to see changes in real-time, which is helpful for manual layout and design.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>If you’re comfortable working directly with code, <strong>VS Code</strong> or <strong>Sublime Text</strong> are excellent, lightweight choices for writing HTML and CSS-based manuals. For a more visual, live-preview experience, <strong>Brackets</strong> or <strong>Pinegrow</strong> can be useful. If you prefer a CMS-like approach but still want to write in HTML/CSS, <strong>Jekyll</strong> or <strong>Pico CMS</strong> can be a good fit.</p>
    <p>Each of these tools allows you to create fully customized, static web manuals using just HTML and CSS.</p>
