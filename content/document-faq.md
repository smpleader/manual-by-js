Sure! Let's differentiate between a **Technical Design Document (TDD)** and a **System Design Document (SDD)** with examples. Both documents are critical in software development but serve different purposes and contain different levels of detail.

---

### **System Design Document (SDD)**
The **SDD** provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, components, and interactions. It focuses on the "what" and "where" of the system, describing how different parts of the system work together.

#### **Example: SDD for an E-Commerce Platform**
1. **System Overview**:  
   - The e-commerce platform consists of a frontend (user interface), backend (server logic), and database.  
   - Users can browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders.  

2. **Architecture Diagram**:  
   - A high-level diagram showing the interaction between the frontend, backend, and database.  

3. **Modules**:  
   - **Product Management Module**: Handles product listings, search, and details.  
   - **Order Management Module**: Manages order creation, payment processing, and order tracking.  
   - **User Management Module**: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.  

4. **Data Flow**:  
   - Describes how data flows between modules (e.g., user data flows from the frontend to the backend and is stored in the database).  

5. **Technologies**:  
   - Frontend: React.js  
   - Backend: Node.js  
   - Database: MongoDB  

---

### **Technical Design Document (TDD)**
The **TDD** dives deeper into the technical implementation details. It focuses on the "how" of the system, providing specifics about algorithms, data structures, APIs, and code-level design.

#### **Example: TDD for the "Order Management Module" in the E-Commerce Platform**
1. **Module Overview**:  
   - The Order Management Module handles order creation, payment processing, and order tracking.  

2. **Class Diagrams**:  
   - **Order Class**:  
     - Attributes: `orderId`, `userId`, `productList`, `totalAmount`, `status`  
     - Methods: `createOrder()`, `cancelOrder()`, `updateStatus()`  
   - **Payment Class**:  
     - Attributes: `paymentId`, `orderId`, `amount`, `paymentMethod`  
     - Methods: `processPayment()`, `refundPayment()`  

3. **Database Schema**:  
   - **Orders Table**:  
     - Columns: `order_id (PK)`, `user_id`, `total_amount`, `status`, `created_at`  
   - **Payments Table**:  
     - Columns: `payment_id (PK)`, `order_id (FK)`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`  

4. **API Endpoints**:  
   - **Create Order**:  
     - Endpoint: `POST /api/orders`  
     - Request Body: `{ "userId": 123, "productList": [ { "productId": 1, "quantity": 2 } ] }`  
     - Response: `{ "orderId": 456, "status": "created" }`  
   - **Cancel Order**:  
     - Endpoint: `PUT /api/orders/{orderId}/cancel`  
     - Response: `{ "orderId": 456, "status": "cancelled" }`  

5. **Algorithms**:  
   - **Order Total Calculation**:  
     - Pseudocode:  
       ```plaintext
       totalAmount = 0
       for each product in productList:
           totalAmount += product.price * product.quantity
       ```  

6. **Error Handling**:  
   - If payment fails, the order status is updated to "payment_failed," and the user is notified.  

7. **Dependencies**:  
   - Depends on the **User Management Module** for user authentication and the **Product Management Module** for product details.
